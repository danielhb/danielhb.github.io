This site will be used to discuss technical challenges and issues I've found across the road, or some other topic(not necessarily tech related) I feel the need to talk about.

My bio about me can be found in the 'About' section in the page.

Getting a site up in github-io using Jekyll is not an outstanding technical achievement, but it took me a couple of days to get this rolling. As such, I'll post here the sources I've used to get it done:

[The github-io documentation](https://pages.github.com/) - this source alone is enough to get a simple blog running.

[This tutorial with Jekyll and Github Pages](https://silversurfer0.github.io/tutorial/2017/09/13/Jekyll-with-github-pages.html) - the Disqus section in particular was helpful.

[Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) - general Jekyll documentation.

[Ryan Palo Jekyll Tags tutorial](https://dev.to/rpalo/jekyll-tags-the-easy-way) - apparently Github-pages does not care about jekyll plug-ins to generate simple tags functionality. This tutorial was very useful.
